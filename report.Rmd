# Abstract

Despite the fact that women's economic participation has increased significantly in recent decades, women continue to be under-represented in many areas. This project analyses whether gender differences are reflected in gendered laws that affect women's access to resources, their activities, and the constraints they face. Data used for this project are from open data sources World Bank and V-Dem. To investigating the relationship between gendered laws and women's economic participation between 1997 to 2021, firstly, an overview of the women, business and law index was conducted to give a clear picture of the progress was made in terms of reforms to a achieve more gender equal laws across 8 indicators, different regions and at country level. Although the improvement is noticeable, there is still room to improve. Next, analysis was done on the number of law reforms enacted across regions over the years. Most reforms were made in areas of workplace, pay protections and regulations affecting working parents and regions like Sub-Saharan Africa enacted more laws in addressing women's rights over the years. Furthermore, by combining the women, business and the law index and the gender gap index and modelling with a regression model, it shows a positive association between laws and gender equality. Nations with fewer laws targeting women (more gender equal laws) tend to also have better access to resources and opportunities across genders. Finally, a drill-down analysis on the 8 indicators, mobility, workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood, entrepreneurship, assets and pension by exploring the improvement made on the laws that target these specific areas shows that there are still countries that have unjustifiable laws that are holding women back in every aspect of their life.

# Background
For the past 47 years, International Women's Day has been celebrated worldwide on the 8th of March. It honours women's social, economic, cultural, and political achievements. The day also serves as a rallying cry for greater gender equality. Although the past decades have been significant progress for women's and girls' rights. Overall, though, progress has been uneven and slow. The worldwide gender gap will not close for another 100 years at the current rate of progress [@UnitedNations]. 

<br>

# Objectives and significance

This analysis aims to identify the progress made on reducing bias in the creation of laws which can disadvantage women - both socially and economically between 1971 to 2021. Therefore, the objective of the project is divided into three parts: overview of women's economic participation around the globe; the total number of law reforms enacted around the world to achieve legal equality and the trend of the score for individual law between 1971 to 2021; and to the progress made by each region on achieving legal quality in 9 different topics. The objectives are achieved through:

1. Part 1: analysing the trend of the Women, Business and the Law index by region and at a country level between 1971 to 2021 and investigating the the relationship between the Women, Business and the Law index and the global gender gap index.

2. Part 2: Aggregating the binary response (yes / no) for each law measured by the WBL index to investigate the total number of law reforms across region and different indicators between 1971 and 2021; analysing the trend of the score for each indicator by region and year.

3. Part 3: Comparing the percentage of countries in each region that had laws addressing women's freedom of movement, rights at workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood entrepreneurship, property rights, pension benefits in 1971 and 2021 to assess the progress made in each region; the number of countries that still do not have laws enacted in these topic in 2021; assessing women's legal empowerment by analysing the proportion of seats held by women in parliament in 1998 and 2021; analysing two special cases of female suffrage in Somalia and Kuwait.

This study will provide light on how each region and country went about establishing legal equality. The audience will learn that there is still a long way to go to achieve legal equality and strengthen women's economic involvement through this project, and that it will need a collaborative effort from all countries, regions, and individuals. Furthermore, the initiative will provide useful data for future research that will delve deeper into the various gendered legislation around the world.

# Data and Methodology

## Data sources
The data used in this project consists of 4 separate data set. The women, business and the law data, gender gap index data and gender indicator data were all obtained from open data source The World Bank Data's [Women, Business and the Law Data Portal](https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/wbl-data), [Overall Global Gender Gap Index Portal](https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/af52ebe9?country=BRA&indicator=27959&viz=line_chart&years=2006,2021) and [Gender Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/topic/gender) respectively. The democracy ratings data is also an open-sourced data that sourced from [V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy by University of Gothenburg)](https://www.v-dem.net/vdemds.html).


### The Women, Business and the Law index (WBL index)
The Women, Business and the Law data assess the economic empowerment of women. It is based on the countries' formal laws and regulations that have a bearing on women's economic participation, covering eight areas such as mobility, workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood, entrepreneurship, assets and pension. It tracks how laws affect women at different stages in their working lives and focusing on those laws applicable in the main business city [@civilsdaily]. The data set contains 10 sheets of data, the first two sheets are overall WBL index scores, individual indicator scores that evaluate 35 parts of the law from 190 economies from years 1971 to 2021. The subsequent sheets present answer for the scored questions by 8 indicators. Indicator-level scores are obtained by calculating the unweighed average of the questions within that indicator and scaling the result to 100. Overall scores are then calculated by taking the average of each indicator, with 100 representing the highest possible score, a higher score suggests that there are more laws promoting gender equality [@WBL] (see Table \@ref(tab:wbl-data) for scoring method for WBL data). Missing values in the answer of the scored question mean there are no laws addressing the specific area. 

```{r wbl-data}
tribble(
  ~Score, ~Range,
  "WBL Index",   "0 - 100",
  "Indicator Score",   "0 - 100",
  "Answer to Scored Question",    "Yes/No",
  "Answer Score", "1(Yes)/0(No)"
) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Scoring method for WBL data") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  footnote(general = "The World Bank",
           general_title = "Source:",
           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)

```


### The gender index 
Gender equality is critical to the success of economies and communities. Ensuring the full development and effective deployment of half of the world's entire talent pool has a significant impact on global economic growth, competitiveness, and future-readiness. The Index is more concerned with measuring gaps than with assessing levels. Second, rather than gaps in input data, it captures gaps in outcome variables. Third, rather than focusing on women's empowerment, it rates countries based on gender equality. Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival and Political Empowerment are the four core categories (sub-indexes) that the Global Gender Gap Index covers [@gap]. This data set contains `r length(unique(gap$indicator))` indicators under this four core categories for measuring gender gap across `r length(unique(gap$country_name))` countries from 2006 - 2021, see Table \@ref(tab:gender-index) for explanation of the variable used in this analysis.

```{r gender-index}
tribble(
  ~INDICATOR, ~TYPE, ~RANGE, ~CLARIFICATION, 
  "Overall Global Gender Gap Index", "Index", "0 - 1", "The highest possible score is 1 (equality) and the lowest possible score is 0 (inequality)."
) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Codebook for gender gap index data") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  footnote(general = "The World Bank",
           general_title = "Source:",
           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)
```


### The gender indicator 

There are `r nrow(gender)` observations and `r ncol(gender)` columns in the gender indicator data set. It contains collection of data on `r nrow(read_csv(here("data/API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_4040307/Metadata_Indicator_API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_4040307.csv")))-1` significant gender issues such as education, employment, health, population etc. for period from 1960 to 2021 (see Table \@ref(tab:gender-metadata) for metadata of the gender indicator). As it can be seen from Table \@ref(tab:gender-data), there are a lot of missing values in this data set, not all the indicators have data for the whole period of 1960 to 2021. However, there were only one indicator used in this analysis for period from 1997 - 2021, therefore, missing values can be omitted.

```{r gender-data}
skim(gender) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Summary of missing value of gender indicator data frame (scrollable)") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
```

```{r gender-metadata}
read_csv(here("data/API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_4040307/Metadata_Indicator_API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_4040307.csv")) %>% 
  select(-...5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Codebook of gender indicator (scrollable)") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "400px") %>% 
  footnote(general = "The World Bank",
           general_title = "Source:",
          footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)
```


### The democracy ratings 
This data set contains 483 V-Dam indicator and indices and 59 others indicators from other data sources that measure the complexity of the concept of democracy as a system of rule that goes beyond the simple presence of elections from year 1789 to 2020 [@vdem]. Only one indicator was used in this analysis for assessing women's suffrage. There are missing values in this indicator which represent the no direct national elections, see Table \@ref(tab:vdem-metadata) for metadata of the variable used and Table \@ref(tab:vdem-missing) for details of the missing values in the variable. As stated in Table \@ref(tab:vdem-metadata), the missing value in a specific year simply means no national election.

```{r vdem-metadata}
tribble(
  ~INDICATOR, ~QUESTION, ~CLARIFICATION, ~RESPONSES, 
  "v2elfemrst",   "Are women eligible to vote in national elections", "If there are no (direct) national elections, observations are not coded (missing)", "0: No female suffrage. No women are allowed to vote, but some or all males vote. \n1: Restricted female suffrage. Some women are allowed to vote, and face more or different restrictions than men. \n2: Universal female suffrage. All women are allowed to vote.") %>% 
#   "v2clacjstw", "Do women enjoy equal, secure, and effective access to justice?", "This question specifies the extent to which women can bring cases before the courts without risk to their personal safety, trials are fair, and women have effective ability to seek redress if public authorities violate their rights, including the rights to counsel, defense, and
# appeal.", "0: Secure and effective access to justice for women is non-existent.
# 1: Secure and effective access to justice for women is usually not established or widely respected.
# 2: Secure and effective access to justice for women is inconsistently observed. Minor problems
# characterize most cases or occur rather unevenly across different parts of the country.
# 3: Secure and effective access to justice for women is usually observed.
# 4: Secure and effective access to justice for women is almost always observed.") %>% 
  kable(caption = "Codebook for the democracy ratings data") %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
    footnote(general = "V-Dem",
             general_title = "Source:",
             footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)
```

<br>

```{r vdem-missing}
vdem %>% 
  select(v2elfemrst) %>% 
         #v2clacjstw) %>%

## Methodology

### Overview of the WBL index

To have a general understanding of women's economic participation around the globe, the Women, Business and the law data was used. The yearly score of the WBL index for each country was averaged based on World Bank regions, which include East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, High Income OECD, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa from 1971 to 2021. For example, to determine the average WBL score of South Asia in 2021, the individual scores of each country in the region were summed and then divided by the total number of countries. The global average score is derived by adding the scores of all 190 countries and dividing by 190. As a result, the variations and trends in the WBL score for each region as well as the worldwide average throughout time, can be clearly seen from a line chart. An interactive leaflet map was also created to demonstrate how individual country scores change over time, with the values being calculated directly from the data.

Next, the association of the WBL index and the gender gap at a country level in 2021 was analysed by building a linear regression model, taking the WBL index of 190 countries as the independent variables and gender gap indexes as the dependant variable. The data used in this model are the gender gap data and the WBL index. However, to plot the countries with the their flag requires the ISO-2 country codes, therefore, these ISO-2 country codes were added to the gender gap data according to the country name before joining with the WBL data to create the scatter plot with the regression line. The countries of interest were filtered out to plot with the flag and labelled with country name for interesting insights, they are Iceland, United Kingdom, United States, Mauritius, Serbia, Nepal, China, Namibia, Rwanda, Turkey, Malaysia, Vanuata, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Rep., Bangladesh and Qatar. And all the countries were also coloured by regions on the scatter plot for additional insight. This scatter plot is the final plot that was published by 360info with the special report on the International Women's Day.


### Law reforms enacted by regions

To investigate the total number of law reforms enacted by region and each indicator, the individual indicator data were used. There are total of 8 separated data sets, each data set corresponds to a single indicator and there are different laws included for each indicators. As the response of these individual law is binary (yes or no), firstly, filtering the response to "No" means that there are no laws addressing a specific topic in a country, then counting the "No" response for the laws by region and year, for example, East Asia and Pacific had 17 no responses in 1971. If the count decreases in the next year, it means that the region had law reforms, therefore, by counting the distinct number of the count for each region then minus 1, the total number of reforms for a region between 1971 and 2021 was calculated. The analysis of total reforms for each indicator was achieved by simply joining the individual table of final result of each indicator form the first step. Finally, the trend of the weighted score (calculated by World Bank) of each law indicator was explored by calculating the average score of a region group by year and indicator. 


### Laws and women's empowerment 
This section compares laws addressing women's freedom of movement, rights at workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood entrepreneurship, property rights, pension benefits, political empowerment and suffrage in 1971 and 2021 at a regional and country level.

The WBL indicator data were utilised to conduct a study of each region's progress in relation to the specific legislation in each indicator. Because each law has a binary response (yes or no), to examine the progress made, the proportion of countries in a region that have a specific law safeguarding women's rights in 1971 and 2021 can be compared to see how things have changed. In order to calculate the proportion of countries in a region between 1971 and 2021, the responses were filtered to "Yes," which means "have laws," and the number of "Yes" was counted by grouping the region, year, and specific law (presented as a question in the data set) to get the total number of countries that have enacted the laws. Finally, the percentage is calculated by dividing the count by the total number of countries in a region. A table of the number of countries that still do not have laws enacted for each indicator in 2021 also provided to give insights on how things can be improved at a country level. The number of countries were calculated by filtering the answer to "No" then count the numbers by each question.

In addition to the 8 indicators provided by the WBL data set, the proportion of seats held by women in national parliament and women's suffrage in Somalia and Kuwait were also analysed. The World Bank's gender indicator data was used to visualise the increase in percentage from 1971 and 2021 in each region. The data were filtered to include the same regions as the World Banks' for coherence. The V-dem data was used to investigate the women suffrage in Somalia and Kuwait. The reason why these two countries were chosen is that they are the only countries that without female suffrage in the 21st century and this was achieved filtering the response to "0" (no suffrage) then arrange the year by descending order by country and extract the first value which is the most national election, as each country has different timeline for their national election. It is hard to compare the women suffrage in each country as the timeline for the national election is different, for example, a country may have their national election every 6 years while another country's national election happens every 4 years.
A timeline was created to visualise the changes in women suffrage in Somalia and Kuwait. All categorical responses, "0," "2," and "NA," were utilised to demonstrate how women's suffrage has changed over time in each national election.

# Result and discussion

## Overview of The Women, Business and the Law index (WBL index)

### The WBL index by region and country

The Women, Business, and the Law Index assesses global progress towards gender equality in 190 economies by identifying laws and regulations that limit and encourage women's economic participation [@WBL]. As it can be seen from Figure \@ref(fig:wbl-average), there has been continuous progress being made on the laws that help improve women's legal rights. Over the 5 decades, the global average WBL index has increased substantially, from 45.6 to 76. However, the progress has varied across regions. Europe and Central Asia, OECD High income and Latin America and Caribbean are the three regions than above the global average. Middle East and North Africa made the least progress. Another noteworthy finding is that high-income and Sub-Saharan Africa areas have made the most progress on reforming the laws towards women. Despite these gains, there is still room for improvement. Women are still far from being equal with men and many challenges remain, such as discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be under-represented at all levels of political leadership, 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 report experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12-month period or underpaid compared to males in part-time occupations or informal labour sector with minimal security and limited rights [@UnitedNations2].

The below shiny application shows how the WBL index for 190 countries changes over the years. Regions like Latin America and Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South-east Asia had very low WBL score in the 70s and 80s, but most of the countries in these regions have made improvements over the years, especially countries like Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe stole the spotlight with the greatest improvement and Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden have a perfect score of 100 in 2021.

### The WBL index and gender equality

As it can be observed from Figure \@ref(fig:wblgender) that published by 360info, nations with fewer laws targeting women tend to also have better access to resources and opportunities across genders. Iceland has a perfect score 100 for WBL and a near perfect score for gender gap index and most of the OECD high income countries have less laws against women and they are the leaders in gender equality. Two of the countries from Sub-Saharan Africa also have made incredible progress in narrowing the gender gap by having less gendered laws, they are Namibia and Rwanda. Countries that sit at the lower end of the WBL and Gender indexes are from Middle East and North Africa region, such as Iraq, Yemen Republic and Qatar. Afghanistan is the only country from South Asia that has very low score in both indexes, especially in Gender Gap index.

## Law reforms enacted by regions

Sub-Saharan Africa, OECD High Income and Latin America and Caribbean are the top three regions that reforms the most between 1971 to 2021, with 215 reforms made in Sub-Saharan Africa, 206 reforms made in OECD High Income countries, and 180 reforms made in Latin America and Caribbean. However, only 40 reforms were made in South Asian (see Figure \@ref(fig:reforms)). Furthermore, a drill-down analysis in Figure \@ref(fig:reforms-indi) shows the majority of law reforms were made in the areas of workplace, pay protections and regulations affecting working parents. Sub-Saharan had the most reforms for gender equality in most of the areas, except for parenthood and pay where OECD High Income countries had the most law reforms.

When looking at the overall score for these 8 indicators, the progress has also been uneven across these domains, see Figure \@ref(fig:indi-average). One noticeable finding is that, in comparison to other regions, the Middle East and North Africa has made substantially slower progress in enacting reforms in areas such as marriage and mobility. Although Sub-Saharan was the region that has made significant progress in changing their gendered laws over the years, it's overall score is still relatively low compared to other regions, this indicates that it still has a long way to go to achieve gender equality. The following are some approaches that some of the countries have taken to tackle gender inequity [@Melling_2018]:

- **Germany’s Wage Transparency Act**<br>
"As of January 6, 2018, German law allows workers at companies with more than 200 employees to find out the median remuneration of a colleague of the opposite sex in the same or a comparable role. The median remuneration is based on that of at least six opposite-sex colleagues."

- **Iceland’s Equal Pay Law**<br>
"Gender-based pay discrimination has been illegal in Iceland since 1961. But in the face of a gender wage gap of nearly 6 percent, Iceland adopted a new law in 2018 that requires companies to demonstrate that their wages are fair. By 2022, any public or private body in Iceland employing more than 25 people that has not been independently certified as paying equal wages for work of equal value will face daily fines."

- **Sweden’s Parental Leave**<br>
"Sweden provides 480 days of paid parental leave, to be used before a child is eight. Two-parent households get the full benefit only if each parent takes ninety, non-transferable days off, an effort to ensure that no one parent or gender is seen as the sole caregiver."

- **Morocco’s Law on Domestic Workers**<br>
"In 2016, Morocco passed a law that requires proper labour contracts for domestic workers, limits their daily working hours, guarantees days off and paid vacations, and sets a minimum wage. The law also provides financial penalties for employers who violate these provisions and even prison sentences for repeat offenders."

## Laws and Women's empowerment 


Moving on, let's look at gendered laws vary across different regions. The below series of 8 bar charts demonstrate the existence of the laws with regards to women's mobility, workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood, entrepreneurship, assets and pension in different regions.


### Laws and women's mobility 

Figure \@ref(fig:mob) shows that most of the regions had made progress or else remained a high percentage and had over 70% of the countries that have laws enacted guaranteeing women's mobility in 2021. Middle Eastern and North Africa making the least progress, only around 50% to 60% of the countries have laws enacted in 2021. South Asia even had less countries, only 75% compared to 1971 when it had 88% of the countries that had existing laws. There are still countries that treat women and men differently when it comes to mobility in 2021, see Table \@ref(tab:mobtab). For example, there are still 33 countries where women can not choose where to live the same way as men. In Saudi Arabia, women cannot apply for a passport or travel outside the country without their male guardian’s approval and in practice, the guardians can seek a court order for a woman to return to the family home [@HRW].

### Laws and women in workplace

The workplace indicator analyses laws affecting women's decisions to enter and remain in the labor force, as well as protections against discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace [@workplace]. Figure \@ref(fig:work) clearly shows that in 1971, most of countries did not have laws to women from sexual harassment or gender discrimination in workplace back in 1971 and have made huge progress on law reforms. Almost all the OECD high income countries have enacted different laws to protecting women in the workplace. For example, in 2004 Belgium, enacted legislation protecting women from sexual harassment in employment. It adopted criminal penalties for sexual harassment in employment. It also enacted civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment. In 1999, Denmark prohibited gender discrimination in employment [@Reforms].

### Laws and employment and pay

The pay indicator measures the laws and regulations affecting occupational segregation and the gender wage gap [@pay]. As it can be seen from \@ref(fig:pay) all the regions have made significant progress on equal remuneration at workplace as there were no laws back in 1971 except for some countries in the OECD high income region. Middle East and North Africa still falls behind other regions in enacting laws for all areas for employment and pay. The data also suggests that there is undoubtedly room for improvement as half of the countries around the world that do not have laws for equal remuneration and 72 countries that don not have laws addressing equal rights for women who work in the industrial (see Table \@ref(tab:paytab)).

### Laws and women's marriage

The marriage indicator measures legal constraints related to marriage and divorce [@pay]. Although Figure \@ref(fig:marriage) shows that laws that targets domestic violence have been enacted around the globe, domestic violence is still prevalent around the world, according to WHO estimates, one in every three (30%) women has been victim to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence at some point in their lives and violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health, and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings [@WHO]. And surprisingly, there are 32 countries do not have any laws to protect women from domestic violence (see Table \@ref(tab:marriagetab)), and Russia is the most surprising and notable countries on the list [@Kraut_2019]. Besides, in the Middle East and North Africa, legal issues concerning women's marriage status are often substantially different from those in the West, as it can be seen from Figure \@ref(fig:marriage), some of the countries in these regions still recognised religious matrimonial laws which is a significant impediment to improve women's rights.

### Laws and parenthood

The parenthood indicator examines the laws affecting women’s work after having children [@parenthood]. As mentioned previously, the laws addressing this areas have been improved a lot by countries around the globe, also can be seen from the below Figure \@ref(fig:parenthood), except from Europe and Central Asia that has cut back the maternity leave benefits compared to 1971. However, there is still long way to go to reduce the discrimination, such as reduced wages, minimal parental benefits for women when they become parent, see Table \@ref(tab:parenthoodtab), 144 out of 190 countries that do no have laws that on paid parental leave and there are also significant number of countries that do not have laws addressing other areas of the parenthood.

### Laws and women's entrepreneurship 

The entrepreneurship assesses constraints to women's ability to start and run a business [@entrep]. Most of the countries in their regions have laws that address women's entrepreneurship in opening a bank account, signing a contract or registering a business. Not much countries have laws prohibit discrimination in access credit. OECD high income region has the most countries that have enacted these laws. Table \@ref(tab:entretab) shows that there are still 107 out of 190 countries do no have these laws enacted in 2021. According to @Andrés_Gimeno_Cabo_2021, "one potential bias is that, when seeking financing, women-led small businesses might experience greater difficulties than their men-led counterparts. This could be due to stereotypes portraying female entrepreneurs as less skilled and efficient (taste-based discrimination); to information-related frictions that ground the credit decision on the average characteristics of the group (statistical discrimination); or to the presence of unconscious biases (implicit discrimination / double standards)". Without a doubt, women-led enterprises would face more difficult financing access in all of these scenarios, which would have disastrous effects for business growth, employment, and the economy.

### Laws and women's property rights

The assets indicator analyses gender differences in property and inheritance law [@assets]. Figure \@ref(fig:assets) shows that Middle East and North Africa and South Asia are the two regions that have the least countries have law reforms for protecting women's rights in inhering assets from spouse and parents and for non-monetary contributions. or example, sons and daughters do not have equal inheritance rights in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and the Maldives. Except for Malta, this is true in every country in the Middle East and North Africa [@Almodóvar-Reteguis_2019]. One third of the countries around the globe still need to improve the laws and regulations relevant to gender equality in non-monetary contributions (Table \@ref(tab:assetstab))

### Laws and women's pension benefits

The last indicator, pension assesses laws affecting the size of a woman's pension [@pension]. The gender gap in pension benefits is associated with the gender inequality in pay, according to @Franklin_2021, in reality, it's well known that women earn only 77 cents for every $1 earned by men around the world. The pension disparity between men and women is less well-known, and it is partly a result of that income gap. In particular, the inequalities in pension benefits are presented in areas like absent due to childcare and age at which women can access full pension benefits (see Table \@ref(tab:pensiontab)) and regions like East Asia and Pacific, South Africa, Europe and Central Asia and Middle East and North Africa are making slow progress in reducing imparity (see Figure \@ref(fig:pension)).

### Laws and women's political empowerment 

Figure \@ref(fig:seats) shows that the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments in Latin America and Caribbean has been increasing ever since 1971 and it exceeds all other regions. The figure for East Asia and Pacific has not changed much, only a 4.76% increase over the years, but one country is ahead of the rest countries in Asia in women leadership and it is Bangladesh. Bangladesh has had a female prime minister for over 27 year since it returned to democracy in 1991 and Sheikh Hasina continuing to lead Bangladesh since 2008. In modern history, no country has experienced a longer period of nearly uninterrupted female rule. In addition, an elaborate system of reserved seats for women maintains basic numerical representation in Bangladesh's national parliament and local governing bodies and women are guaranteed positions in a number of sub-national governing bodies [@Haque_2021]. Furthermore, although Middle East and and North Africa has the lowest percentage of seats held by women in national parliaments in 2021, there was a 13.53% increase since 1971.

After analysing the V-dem data, some interesting findings are, there were still countries without female suffrage in 21st century, these countries are Somalia and Kuwait. However, soon after 2006, women in Kuwait now have the rights to vote in national elections. In contrast, women in Somalia used to be able to vote, back in the 80s, but now they are denied the right to vote in the most recent national election in 2017 (see Figure \@ref(fig:suffrage)).
